# 🌀 Agile Refactoring Reflection

## 🧠 Legacy Problem:
The customer module was written procedurally. It had:
- No data persistence
- No modularity
- No UI
- No tests
- Difficult to maintain or extend

## 🛠️ Agile Process Applied:
We followed Agile principles:
1. Analyzed code smells
2. Broke down functionality into modular tasks
3. Used OOP for modular, reusable code
4. Built testable code and added `unittest`
5. Added a Tkinter GUI for usability
6. Ensured persistence using JSON

## ✅ Outcome:
- Module is now scalable and extensible
- Easy to test, read, and maintain
- Looks professional and usable in the real world
- Follows DRY, SRP, and OCP principles

## 🔁 Agile Principles Used:
- Iterative refactoring
- Versioning
- Continuous feedback (via testing + GUI outputs)
